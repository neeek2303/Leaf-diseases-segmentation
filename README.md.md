# "Leaf diseases segmentation"

### Abstract

Monitoring plant status is one of the most im-portant tasks in digital agro.  It is important todetermine the type of disease , as well as its lo-cation,  that can be used for calculation of per-centage of plant damage.  Our task is to fulfillthese two tasks through classification, segmenta-tion and class activation map.  We also presentthe updated Plant Pathology 2020 dataset (4) withground truth masks of leaf diseases.



### Date

We have captured high-quality, real-life
RGB images of apple leafs with diseases from Plant Pathology 2020. Originally dataset contain 3642 images with class labels, there are 4 classes namely healthy, rust disease, scab disease, both diseases. We managed to get ground truth mask disease annotations for 1291 images from dataset (400 images for each of healthy, rust, scab and 91 images for both diseases class). We used only this 1291 images in our work.
